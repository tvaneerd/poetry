Well-modeled Values, strong types with pure functions;  
Generics with templates and Concept conjunctions;  
Ruthless performance is why my app zings!  
These are a few of my favourite things.  

Resource containment with ctors and dtors,   
Plus overloading all the operators;  
Such user power means no native strings!  
These are some features that C++ brings.  

Standard containers, combined with free functions;  
Compilers outputting efficient instructions;  
ABI limits on which we still cling...?  
These are a few of the C++ things!  


When the tests fail  
When the bug stings  
When it's compiling bad  
I simply remember these C++ things  
And then I don't feel so sad.
