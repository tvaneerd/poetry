Aaahhh!  
You say you want to write a function  
Well, you know  
We all want to change the code  
You tell me that it's evolution  
Well, you know  
We all want to change the code  
But when you talk about member functions  
Don't you know that you can count me out?  
Don't you know it's gonna be  
All right  
All right  
All right  

You say you got a real solution  
Well, you know  
We'd all love to see the plan  
You ask me for a contribution  
Well, you know  
We all doing what we can  
But if you want money for params with all that state  
All I can tell you is, developer, you have to wait  
Don't you know it's gonna be  
All right  
All right  
All right  

You say you'll change the param direction  
Well, you know  
We all want to change your head  
You tell me it's the common solution  
Well, you know  
You'd better free your mind instead  
But if you are still writing functions that return void now  
You ain't gonna make it with anyone anyhow  
Don't you know it's gonna be  
All right  
All right  
All right  

All right, all right, all right  
All right, all right, all right  
All right, all right
