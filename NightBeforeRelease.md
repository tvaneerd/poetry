'Twas the night before release  
But VC's were about to divest;  
Not a file was compiling,  
Not even a test.  

The features were logged into jira with care,  
With the hope that developers soon would take care.  
The managers were unsettled and starting to dread,  
Yet visions of huge profits still danced in their heads.  

And Emma via remote, and I in my cube  
Had just racked our brains as to why things were so screwed-  
When out of the server there arose such a clatter,  
I sprang from the desk to see what was the matter.  

After rebooting windows I found out that Flash,  
Had tore through the sandbox, and screwed up the cache.  

The monitor glow on the fresh-written logs  
Gave the lustre of radiation to the myriad of cogs;  
When, what to my wondering eye should appear,  
But a mountainous ship and eight mighty features,  

With a little old driver, so lively but worn,  
I knew in a moment it must be St. Bjarne.  
More sturdy than oxen his coursers they came,  
And he whistled and shouted and called them by name:  

"Now Classes! now Invariants! now, Containers and Algorithms!  
On, SOLID! on, Values! on, Scoped-destruction and C++-isms!  
To the depths of the files! to the compiler -wall!  
Bugs dash away! dash away! dash away all!  

As developers that encounter a roadblock so high,  
When they meet with an obstacle, to google they fly;  
So down through the internet the coursers they flew;  
With the ship full of paradigms, and St. Stroustrup too.  

And then, in a whistle, I heard on the modem  
The sending and ack-ing of each little checksum.  
As I push back my keyboard, and was turning around,  
Down the ethernet St. Stroustrup came with a bound.  

He was dressed all in geek, pocket-protector to boot,  
He brought some strange code, said it could blow off your foot.  
A module of C++ on a USB stick,  
He merged the codebases with naught but a click.  

His eyes - how they twinkled! His hair, bit disheveled!  
His glasses like windows, on his nose they were nestled!  
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,  
and the hair on his head was as white as the snow.  

The remote for his slides he held tight in his hand,  
And waved it about as-if conducting a band.  
He had a curved mouse and an IBM keyboard,  
That clacked when he typed, like a Honda Accord.  

He was slender and lean, a right sprightly old elf,  
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself.  
A blink from his laptop and a twisted-pair cable,  
Soon gave me to know he was much more than able.  

He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,  
And fixed all the bugs, then turned with a jerk.  
And laying his finger aside of his mouse,  
And giving a nod, the monitor de-gaussed.  

He sprang to his ship, to his team gave a whistle,  
And away they all flew like a C++-coded missle.  
But I heard him exclaim, 'ere he drove out of sight,  
"Happy Programming to all, and... check out my website!"
