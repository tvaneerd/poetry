I got it bad  
You don't know how bad I got it  
You got it easy  
You don't know when you've got it good  

It's getting harder  
Just keeping bytes and code together  
I'm sick of typing  
Even though I know I should  

The code is writing  
Through each and every thread and fibre  
My broken program is dumping out its core  
I don't want to be here no more
