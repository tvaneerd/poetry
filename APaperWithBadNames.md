I've been through the papers, found some stuff with bad names  
It felt bad to be causing dev pain  
In the standard you need stuff with good names  
Cause there ain't no one for to help you explain  
La la, la la-la la  

After two days in the standard tome  
My brain began to turn dead  
After three days with the standard combed  
I was looking at a lot of dread  
And the story it told of those names in code  
Made me sad to think of our devs  

You see I've been through the papers, found some stuff with bad names  
It felt bad to be causing dev pain  
In the standard you need stuff with good names  
Cause there ain't no one for to help you explain  
La la, la la-la la
