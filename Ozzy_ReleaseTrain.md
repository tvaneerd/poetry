_Herb Sutter played Ozzy's Crazy Train on piano at a C++ committee meeting.   
Herb is also in charge of the C++ standard's "release train" (releasing C++ every 3 years), so..._

All aboard! Hahahahahahaha!  
(I-I-I-I-I...)

Crazy, but that's how it goes  
Millions of programmers, working at code  
Maybe, it's not too late  
To write a proposal, and submit by the date  

Paper flaws not healing, code's a bitter shame

I'm going off the rails on the release train  
I'm going off the rails on the release train

I've listened to masters, I've listened to fools  
I've watched all the core group, who write all the rules  
One person petitioned, my rule breaks flow control  
The plenary says TS, and I'm stuck in the role  

Paper flaws still reeling, driving me insane  

I'm going off the rails on the release train  
I'm going off the rails on the release train  

I know that things are going wrong for me  
You gotta help me with the words, Yeah yeah!  

Heirs of a paper war, that's what we've become  
Inheriting troubles, I'm mentally numb  
Crazy, I just cannot bear  
I'm living with something, that just isn't fair  

Paper flaws not healing, who and what's to blame  

I'm going off the rails on the release train  
I'm going off the rails on the release train
