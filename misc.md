#### B. Spears on girl coders:  

All you people look at me like I'm a little girl  
Well did you ever think it'd be ok for me to step into this world  

Always saying little girl don't step into the club  
Well I'm just tryin' to find out why 'cause coding's what I love

Tell me why...

#### BSB #2

Even in my heart I see  
You're not bein' true to me  
Deep within my soul I feel  
Nothing's like it used to be  

Quit playin' games with my code.

#### M.C++. Grammar

So much code's gotta turn  
The code's legit either work hard  
Or you might as well quit  
That's *const* because you know  
Can't touch *this* (oh-oh oh oh-oh-oh)  
No, can't touch *this*...

#### Red-Black

**Eric Niebler**  
I see a red node and I want to paint it black.  
No red nodes anymore I want them to turn black.  

**Tony Van Eerd**  
I see the T's go by wrapped in their standard nodes  
I have to churn my head until my balance grows

When choosing a container, remember vector is best;  
Leave a comment to explain if you choose one from the rest!
