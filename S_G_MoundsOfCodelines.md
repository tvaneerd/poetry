Hello debugger, my old friend  
I've come to walk with you again  
Because a coworker softly typing  
Left their bugs while I was Skyping  
And the issue that was given bug-bounty claim  
Still remains  
Within the mound of codelines  

In restless bouts I walk alone  
Bloated paths of template code  
'Neath the halo of a free func  
I turned my caller into the old and true  
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a modern light  
That split the night  
And touched the mound of codelines  

And in the modern light I saw  
Ten thousand people, maybe more  
People coding without thinking  
People observing without listening  
People threading without locking  
People naming without caring  
People optimizing without measuring  
People allocating without freeing  
People throwing without raii-ing  
People writing without testing  
People testing without automating  
People committing without compiling  
People looping without bounding  
People dereffing without checking  
People deriving without aggregating  
People adding without refactoring  
...  
People writing code that reviewers never glared  
No one dared  
Disturb the mound of codelines  
"Fools" said I, "You do not know  
A codebase, like a cancer, grows  
Watch my vids that I might teach you  
Take my code that I might reach you"  
But my words, like silent conversions, fell  
And echoed in the hells of codelines  
And the people bowed and prayed  
To the modern god they made  
And the compiler flashed out its warnings  
In the words that it was forming  
And the sign said, "The words of the profits  
Are written on the appstore walls  
And cubicle halls"  
And whispered in the mounds of codelines
