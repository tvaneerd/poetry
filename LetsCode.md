Let's Code  
Pull up your keyboard and code things new  
Let's Code  
To the stuff they're sending via stdio  
Let's test  
While pixels fill up arrays  
Let's test  
Test through the case with a "benign" race  

If you say run,  
I'll run it for you.  
And if you say IDE,  
Well I'm your I-D-E  

I have your code for you,  
I'll break at a line or two.  
If it should fall,  
and lead to a change,   
I'll compile with all my power.
