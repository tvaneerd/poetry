  
Constexpr if constexpr if  
I have lived just for this  
I can explain why I do not  
Miss SFINAE  
  
enable_if enable_if  
Held me captive - just a bit  
But I can explain why I do not  
Miss SFINAE  
  
Every time I'd specialize  
Clouds of errors  
Burst from the compiler  
  
Don't ask why, don't ask why  
I'll reply with just a sigh  
But I can explain why I do not  
Miss SFINAE  
Miss SFINAE...
