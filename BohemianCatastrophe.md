Is this the real plan?  
This must be fantasy.  
Caught in a deadline  
far removed from reality.  

Open your eyes  
Look up all the bugs and see  
I'm just a rich dev, I need some sympathy  
But I'm easy come, easy go  
Stock price high, stock price low  
Anyway the firm goes, doesn't really matter to me, to me  

Mama, just wrote UB  
Put a gun against my foot  
Pulled the trigger, now it's live  
Mama, startup had just begun  
But now I've gone and thrown it all away  

Mama, whoops, didn't mean to make that fry  
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow  
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really happened  

Too late, my time has come  
Sent resumes 'round the net,  
email's dinging all the time  
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go  
Gotta leave you all behind and take that job  

Mama, ooh, (any way the firm goes)  
I don't want to try{}  
I sometimes wish we'd never used throw at all  

I see a little C++ without a plan  
Static member? static member! And does that reference dangle?  
Thread support and templates, very, very fright'ning me  
(Variadics) initializers, (RAII) CRTP, NonStaticDataMembers SFINAE NRVO-O-O-O-O  

Dumb code review where nobody loves me  
You're just a bad dev destroying our company  
Spare our codebase from your monstrosities  

Easy come, easy go, will you let it go?  
It's named wrong! No, we will not let it go. (Let it go!)  
It's named wrong! We will not let it go. (Let it go!)  
It's named wrong! We will not let it go. (Let it go!)  
Will not let it go. (Let it go!)  
Never let it go (Never, never, never, never let it go)  
Oh oh oh oh  
No, no, no, no, no, no, no  
(Oh mamma mia, mamma mia) Mama mia, let me go  
Management has a paper left to sign for me, for me, for me  

So you think you can own me and all of my time?  
So you think you can smear me and leave it online?  
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!  
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here!  

Oh oh oh yeah, oh oh yeah  
Nothing really matters, anyone can see  
Nothing really matters.....  
Coding really matters to me  
(Any way the firm goes)
