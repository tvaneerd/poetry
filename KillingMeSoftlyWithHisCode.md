Causing me pain with his fingers  
Filling my app with his code  
Killing me softly with his code  
Killing me softly with his code  
Filling my whole life with his code  
Killing me softly with his code  
  
I heard he wrote some good code, I heard he had a style  
And so I came to see him, to listen for a while  
And there he was, this bad dev, a bungler to my eyes‎  
  
Causing me pain with his fingers  
Filling my app with his code‎  
Killing me softly with his code  
Killing me softly with his code  
Filling my whole life with his code  
Killing me softly with his code  
  
I felt all flushed with anger, embarrassed by the code  
I felt he'd found my patterns and turned each one around  
I prayed that he would finish, but he just kept right on  
  
Causing me pain with his fingers  
Filling my app with his code  
Killing me softly with his code  
Killing me softly with his code  
Filling my whole life with his code  
Killing me softly with his code
