If you change your mind, on the node first in line  
Honey I was freed  
Take a chance on me  
If you freed me, now you know, I'll come back around  
Head's got a place for a node, when the stack's popping down  

If head finds my node when the other nodes have gone  
Honey I was freed  
Take a chance on me  
Gonna do my very best, but I may be a lie  
If you use me in the CAS, if you let me try  
Take a chance on me  
Take a chance on me  
Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance on me
