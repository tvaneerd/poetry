Now I've heard there was a secret code  
That Duff did type, and it eased the load  
But you don't really care for coding, do you?  
It goes like this  
The for, the switch  
The minor fallthrough, the performance lift  
The baffled dev composing unrolled loops, yeah  
Unrolled loops, yeah  
Unrolled loops, yeah  
Unrolled loops, yeah  
Unrolled loo-oo-oo-oo-oops, yeah
