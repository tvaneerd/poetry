This started as a post from Eric Niebler:

And then I replied:

And now (much later) finally, the whole thing:


I see a red node and I want to paint it black.  
No red nodes anymore I want them to turn black.   
I see the T's go by wrapped in their standard nodes  
I have to churn my head until my balance grows  

I see a line of nodes and they're all painted black  
With rotates and my code, both never to come back  
I see parents turn their kids and quickly point away  
Like a new pushed value, it just happens every day  

I look inside my node and see my node is black  
I see my red bro, I must have it painted black  
Maybe then I'll loop away and not have to trace the paths  
It's not easy pushing in when your whole row is black  

No more will Guibas and Sedgewick turn a deeper hue  
I could not foresee this thing happening to you  
If I look hard enough at optimi-zation  
My code will crash on me before the morning comes  

I see a red node and I want to paint it black.  
No red nodes anymore I want them to turn black.  
I see the T's go by wrapped in their standard nodes  
I have to churn my head until my balance grows  

Brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr  
Brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr  
Brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr  
Brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr  

I wanna see it painted, painted black  
Black as night, black as coal  
I wanna see the item, blotted out from the map  
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted  
Painted black, yeah  

Brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr  
Brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr  
Brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr  
Brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr
