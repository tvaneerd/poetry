Dig if you will the picture  
Of variant<T,U> engaged in a switch  
The scope of a case body covers T  
Can you my darling  
Can you picture this?  

Dream if you can of Concepts  
Of Modules and Reflection in bloom  
Developers strike curious..ly recurring template patterns  
They feel the treat  
The treat between C++20 and you  

How can you just leave me standing?  
Alone in this code that's so old? (So old)  
Maybe I'm just too demanding  
Maybe I'm just like C++17 predictions - too bold.  

Maybe I'll just try some other  
Language to satisfy (never satisfied)  
Why do we tweet at each other  
This is what it sounds like  
When devs cry
