Code is a churning thing  
And it makes a coder sting  
Bound by algo desire  
I fell in to the Ranges mire  

I fell in to the churning Range mire  
I went down, down, down  
And the compiles went higher  

And it churns, churns, churns  
The Ranges mire  
The Ranges mire  

I fell in to the churning Ranges mire  
I went down, down, down  
And the compiles went higher  
And it churns, churns, churns  
The Ranges mire  
The Ranges mire  

The taste of code is sweet  
When abstractions meet  
I fell for it like a child  
Oh, but my aspire went wild  

I fell in to the churning Ranges mire  
I went down, down, down  
And the compiles went higher  

And it churns, churns, churns  
The Ranges mire  
The Ranges mire  

I fell in to the churning Ranges mire  
I went down, down, down  
And the compiles went higher  
And it churns, churns, churns  
The Ranges mire  
The Ranges mire  
And it churns, churns, churns  
The Ranges mire  
The Ranges mire
